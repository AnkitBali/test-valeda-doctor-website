                                   <p style="font-size:18px;color: black;line-height: 26px;"> Electrolysis is a permanent hair removal procedure. Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode. Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

                                   <p style="font-size:18px;color: black;line-height: 26px;"> Electrolysis is a permanent hair removal procedure. Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode. Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode.

<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

                                   <p style="font-size:18px;color: black;line-height: 26px;"> Electrolysis is a permanent hair removal procedure. Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode. Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.

                                   <p style="font-size:18px;color: black;line-height: 26px;"> Electrolysis is a permanent hair removal procedure. Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode. Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

                                   <p style="font-size:18px;color: black;line-height: 26px;"> Electrolysis is a permanent hair removal procedure. Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode. Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

Regardless of the colour of the hair - white, grey or black, cause - hereditary, metabolic or hormonal conditions, gender - male, female or transgender, the electrolysis will permanently remove unwanted hair to reveal a glowing, confident you. Electrolysis is the same concept as you read in high school chemistry where a positive and negative electrode is used to pass direct or galvanic impulse in a solution for ionisation. In the field of permanent hair removal the follicle becomes a miniature vessel containing body fluids as solution and the probe acts as the negative electrode or the cathode. Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.

Electrolysis has become a generic term today that indeed is grossly  misunderstood as any procedure conducted with the help of a needle or correctly termed with the help of a probe. To understand electrolysis hair removal ,first you need to understand that the method of hair removal can be temporary or permanent. In the interest of the permanent hair removal seekers the the experts and doctors at Valeda Skin and Hair Clinic have explained the terms in the following easy format:<br>
                                    <strong><br>The temporary methods are divided in three categories as follows:</strong><br><br>

 <strong>A. Temporary Cutting </strong>of hair at skin surface by scissors, razor, depilatories or hair removal creams which are also known as the chemical shavings.
<br><br>
<strong>B. Temporary Pulling</strong> of hair by using Pluckers ,Tweezers, Waxing, Katori Wax, Hot or Cold Wax, Threading, Multani Mitti, Besan Ubtan or Honey etc. The pulling causes an increase in micro circulation that brings better nourishment causing not only the further growth sturdier as compared to its predecessor but the number also keeps on increasing. The effect is more prominent in testosterone sensitive areas like the chin and under-chin and side face where the hair is genetically programmed to grow up to 30 cm or 1 feet. Do not get disillusioned by the effects you may have noticed after waxing sessions on arms and legs because the hair in these distal body areas are genetically programmed to grow up to a few millimetres only.
<br><br>
<strong>C. Temporary LASER:</strong> Laser or Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of  Radiation is a method where a Monochromatic Ray gets into the skin targeting the melanin or the dark pigment of the hair root there by generating a heat that predominantly segregates the hair root from the follicle but the follicle remains alive that gives rise to a new hair subsequently. Due to this limitation, lasers are not effective for permanence in a statistically high number of cases and therefore the medical and regulatory bodies over the world do not consider Laser as a permanent hair removal system. Laser is a substitute for waxing where the hair grows, better to say pops out of skin, after 3 months unlike waxing where they grow after one month. So laser is not bad but it is not permanent and that is why the misleading term reduction was introduced in 1995 by laser manufacturers over denied permission by US FDA to claim that their gadget can affect permanent hair removal. We at Valeda Hair and Skin Clinic do use lasers, but  only to capitalise on the limited capabilities of this gadget.
<br><br>
<strong>In the permanent hair removal:</strong> The probe functions as an electrode that carries the impulse from the equipment to the base of the follicle to eliminate it by the process of coagulation. There is no electrocution, electrodesiccation, burning or charring. This impulse is carried by the probe or generated at the base of the follicle as the case may be divided into 4 broad categories viz.
<br><br>
Galvanic that is also known as Electrolysis. For permanent hair removal as it uses 0.5 mA of DC impulse that breaks the water molecules of the hair follicle and the salts into their constitution ions the recombination of which produces the NaOH or KOH that dissolves the cells of the hair follicle.
<br><br>
Thermolysis also known as Shortwave, Diathermy, High frequency or Radio frequency for permanent hair removal as it uses 13.56 MHz/ 27.12 MHz/ 54.24 MHz of the impulses that vibrates the water molecules of the hair follicle to coagulate the proteins thereby affecting the permanent hair removal.
<br><br>
The blend of the above two i.e Galvanic and the Thermolysis for the permanent hair removal. This technique which is commonly known as the blend technique combines the permanence of galvanic and swiftness of thermolysis in 262 combinations. 
<br><br>
The Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal: Although all three above said techniques cause permanent hair removal by the fact that the hair follicle once eliminated is permanently gone as the human body does not make these after the birth of an individual. It was in 1990 that Doctor Seema Bali, MD in her practice felt the plight of permanent hair removal seekers and her years of work with constitutional homoeopathic remedies gave birth to the Holistic Combination Mode for permanent hair removal that is more particularly addresses the causative or stimulative or triggering internal factors in a female and its subsequent correction by the constitutional remedies. The permanence achieved is much faster as compared to any of the above said three techniques used independently. This helped thousands of individuals who were suffering with the plight of unwanted hair growth and were seeking remedies through safe, fast and effective permanent hair removal.
