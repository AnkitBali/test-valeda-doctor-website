                            <p><strong>1. Is  LASER Hair Reduction done at Valeda?</strong></p>
                            <p class="m-b20">Yes we do LASER hair reduction, rather we are the one to be offered first LASER of the country at times when in 1995 the US FDA gave LASER equipment the marketing approval but denied claims that the equipment could affect 'Permanent Hair Removal'
</p>

<p><strong>2. Is LASER Hair Reduction Permanent?</strong></p>
<p class="m-b20">No it is not. As quoted by Silvia the then Vice President of Thermolase, the world's largest medical LASER manufacturer company, there is no LASER in the world that is permanent. LASER is only a substitute to waxing where the hair reappear in three months instead of one month.</p>


 

<p><strong>3. Are there any Government benchmarks/ yard sticks for deciding on 'Permanence'      Claims?</strong></p>
<p class="m-b20">Yes but not so in India. In USA  the US FDA does regulates the standards it's stand on permanence can be seen on the following links</p>

</p>

<p><strong>4. Why the misleading claims in the name of LASER when it is not permanent?</strong></p>

<p class="m-b20">Over the years around the world women and men are skeptical and utterly confused as to the validity of the 'Permanent Hair Removal' claims, due to reasons varying from media hype to lack of knowledge. This trillion dollar industry worldwide also saw many misleading claims due to the kind of quick wealth associated with the industry. Absence of Government regulations/ controls on claims for 'Permanence' and standards for equipments  further added to the public suffering more particularly in the countries like India.</p>

 
<p><strong>5. Do we have 'Permanent Hair Removal' at Valeda?</strong></p>
<p class="m-b20">Yes we do have completely successful 'Permanent Hair Removal' treatments at Valeda since 32 years. Permanent hair removal in females as well as males with a time bound certainty has become a welcoming reality at Valeda Wellness Centers. By using the basics of Homoeopathy supported by combined modalities, by following American FDA's directive findings and by associations with an International Guild, American Electrology Association our institute has specialized in whole body 'Permanent Hair Removal' systems in shortest duration i.e. reduction of treatment time by more than five times in such cases.</p>

 <p><strong>6. Since how long 'Permanent Hair Removal' is being done worldwide?</strong>

<p class="m-b20">Women and men alike had attempted 'Permanent Hair Removal' since hundreds of years until Dr Michel had crude success in 1875 and then in 1923 it became a welcome reality when Dr Bordier in Paris successfully eliminated the hair permanently with a charged probe. The basics of 'Permanent Hair Removal' industry remain same since then, with modifications in equipments only on levels of presentation, delivery and monitoring. Success lies in knowledge, expertise and experience rather than in brand name of equipments.</p>

 <p><strong>7. Are there some scientific/ medical facts that support the 100% 'Permanent Hair Removal' at Valeda?</strong></p>

<p class="m-b20">Yes the concept is based on fact that human body is born with sac like structures, the follicles that grow and support hair under the skin and there is no new addition of follicles in life time. This follicle when is eliminated along with its surrounding potential germ cells, it's hair shall never be able to grow. For the left over follicles the enabling of judicious constitutional holistic approach retards the new and regrowth. It is thus the Permanent Hair Removal.</p>

 <p><strong>8. I want to know more about 'Permanent Hair Removal' at Valeda. Where can I get this information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>9. What causes the unwanted hair growth in females? Is it hormonal problem? Am I, with hair on face a true female? Are medically significant cases also permanently treatable?</strong></p>

<p class="m-b20">
Excessive hair growth in men and women is termed as Hirsutism, Hypertrichosis or Superfluous Hair. Above 90% of female sufferers fall into Superfluous Hair category where the unwanted hair are only undesirable socially and the sufferer is not medically ill. Few known reasons for this condition ranges from malnutrition in children, anorexia nervosa and underlying malignancy to drug interaction.</p>

 <p class="m-b20">

The hair do not grow from soil like weeds do; they need to be encouraged. The causes may be congenital, topical or systemic. Besides, it could be  direct local factors like increased micro blood circulation or hormonal stimulation. It may also be drug induced hirsutism. Also in the normal cases, that form 90% of the sufferers, in females the normal change in life period like puberty, pregnancy and menopause cause unwanted hair to temporarily sprout from upper lip, chin, side face, chest or back.  The hair go away on their own once the change in body chemistry is over. In medically significant cases, that form only 10% of the sufferers, it could be abnormal changes when ovaries, adrenal cortex or pituitary is involved. These are also treatable with permanence.</p>

 <p class="m-b20">

The painting by Jusepe de Ribera, displayed at Hospital de Tavera in Toledo, Spain since 400 years signifies a message for public in general that a bearded woman can also become a normal mother</p>

 <p class="m-b20">

The causative factors here should not be confused with endocrine or hormonal factors that laymen usually refer to. Remember that a female case of endocrine disorder shall have the prime contributory hormone testosterone increased by more than double of higher normal limits of 1.1 nanogram per 100 ml. So, the hormone is not a direct culprit in more than 90% of sufferers of unwanted hair females, as is wrongly generalised. Also, therefore the intake of generic  spironolactone as hormone blocker has limited or no effect on reversal of unwanted hair growth even in androgen sensitive body areas.</p>
<p class="m-b20">
 

But the most prominent reason that Valeda Wellness doctors have observed over past 32 years is the wrong hair removal methods, wherein hair is pulled in attempt to rid it permanently. This causes increase in local capillary circulation providing better nourishment for keratin biosynthesis and increased undesirable hair growth.</p>


<p><strong>10. What are the All Types of Hair Removal Methods?</strong></p>

<p class="m-b20">The Hair Removal can be Temporary, Permanent or Holistically Permanent methods.</p>
<p class="m-b20">A.   Temporary Methods Include:</p>
<p class="m-b20">a.    Cutting of hair at skin surface by scissors, shaving or depilatories the hair removing chemicals. The side effects include skin abrasions cuts and reactions</p>
<p class="m-b20">b.    Pulling of hair by Threading, Waxing, Tweezers or by Electronic tweezers. Simple pulling causes the hair regrow sturdier as microcirculation around the follicle increases to repair the tissues damaged by pulling injury. The effect is more pronounced in androgen stimulated areas of body like Face & Chest and where the follicles are programmed to grow up to 30 cm as in chin, under chin and side face area. The distal proximities like arms and legs have follicles that are genetically programmed to grow up to few cm only, so do not make a mistake of managing face area by waxing as you do for arms and legs.</p>
<p class="m-b20">c.    Photo depilation: The heat generated by radiation targeting the hair pigment melanin by LASER (Light Amplification of Stimulated Emission of Radiation) or  IPL (Intensed Pulsed Light) loosens the bonding between outer layer of hair root and inner layer of follicle thereby removing the hair by 'root' and sparing the follicles potential germ cells to regrow hair subsequently although at larger time interval as that when waxed. Remember that both the hair shaft and the hair root are dead appendages formed by protein keratin. Unless the living hair follicle and its potential germ cells are removed the permanence can not be achieved. Laser so can not affect 'Permanent Hair Removal'.<br><br>

The radiation can not distinguish between the pigment of skin or hair so the side effects of laser hair removal more particularly in dark skinned individuals can include blistering, discoloration after treatment, swelling, redness and scarring. Sunlight should be avoided during healing after the procedure.<br><br>

 

Those who decide to use a skin-numbing product should be careful as FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has received reports of serious and life-threatening side effects after use of large amounts of skin-numbing products for laser hair removal.<br><br>

 

The use of Laser hair removal has increasingly grown, prompting many laser manufacturers to seek US FDA clearance for their lasers for the 'Permanent Hair Removal' indication. On being refused any such permission they settled for the ambiguous term, 'Permanent Hair Reduction' that was coined for the sole purpose of getting the word 'Permanent' into advertising.  Many promoters are emphasizing the word 'Permanent' and, in most cases, eliminating the word 'Reduction' The term is too similar to 'Permanent Hair Removal' which probe practitioners and the public understand to mean, that at the end of a course of treatment none of the treated follicles will ever grow another hair.  No laser has been demonstrated to be able to achieve such a result. The American Electrology Association(AEA) that is the largest professional membership organization for practitioners of 'Permanent Hair Removal' and is regulating the profession since 1958 has  its name saying American, but its membership is actually international. Dr Seema Bali was the member as early as in 1990. AEA points that it regrets that the FDA has allowed the use of new terminology which sounds deceptively similar to the established term. They were refused such permission initially. The further information can be taken by link: http://electrology.com/about.html</p>

 <p><strong>B. Epilation or The Permanent Hair Removal Methods:</strong></p>
 <p class="m-b20">After specialised three years training course the State Laws in USA require licence for practitioners as electrologists and even a medical doctor needs specialised training and license if he wishes to practice electrology. India still does not have such regulatory laws.</p>
 <p class="m-b20">a.    The Galvanic or Electrolysis: The micro DC impulse delivered at base of the follicle by a probe thinner than that of hair shaft creates a chemical that targets the follicle and eliminates it. The US FDA recognises this method as Permanent Hair Removal.</p>

<p class="m-b20">b.    The Radio Frequency,  Short Wave, Diathermy, High frequency or Thermolysis: The tip of the tiny probe generates a conical field of action at the base of the follicle to make water molecules vibrate resulting in coagulation of follicular proteins and thereby permanently eliminating it. There is no burning, no desication, no charring, no electrocution but simply the proteins lose their structure and thereby coagulate to affect permanence. The FCC or Federal Communication Commission allows equipments to operate at 13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz or 40.68 MHz frequencies.</p>
<p class="m-b20">c.    The Blend or Combination Mode: The probe acts as an electrode and allows the operator to selectively superimpose or choose single or combined modalities depending on the type of hair follicle, its shape, body area, skin sensitivity, moisture or oil gradients, growth cycles amongst  few parameters. This mode may have above 100 type of combinations and is highly effective but needs high level of expertise and experience.</p>

 <p><strong>C. Holistically  Permanent Hair Removal Methods At Valeda:</strong></p>
 
 <p class="m-b20">In 1985 Dr Seema Bali as an upcoming Homoeopath Dermatologist sensed the plight of females seeking 'Permanent Hair Removal' and this made her focus her work scientifically in this direction. In 1990 she joined AEA and International Guild as only medical doctor member out of their strength of 3500 international members. Today, her efforts of 32 years have yielded  much sought after relief to thousands of females through Holistically Permanent Hair Removal Method, a term coined by her to summarize her years of work in this direction. The method focuses on underlying causative factors and retards the hair growth from the androgen sensitive body areas by restoring the femininity of the sufferer. In short the holistic approach here refers to the powerful contribution of her basic qualification as a Homoeopath that empowered her to eradicate basic causative factors by striking correct balance of a Healthy mind, Healthy spirit and Healthy body for every individual. The causative factors here should not be confused with endocrine or hormonal factors that laymen usually refer to. Remember that a female case of endocrine disorder shall have the prime contributory hormone testosterone increased by more than double of higher normal limits of 1.1 nanogram per 100 ml. So, the hormone is not a direct culprit in more than 90% of sufferers of unwanted hair females, as is wrongly generalised. Also, therefore the intake of generic  spironolactone as hormone blocker has limited or no effect on reversal of unwanted hair growth in androgen sensitive body areas.<br><br>

 

Permanent hair removal in females as well as males with a time bound certainty has always been a welcome reality at Valeda Wellness Centers. By using the basics of Specialised Homoeopathy supported by Combination modalities while following American FDA's directive findings and by associations with International Guild, American Electrology Association(AEA) and other World bodies Valeda technical team has specialized in whole body 'Permanent Hair Removal' systems in shortest duration i.e. reduction of treatment time by more than five times in such cases.
<br><br>

Ever since doordarshan times Dr Seema Bali had been invited to discuss this topic by various TV channels. The copies of these write ups can be taken from Valeda Wellness Centers and some 72 TV programs can be seen on Youtube.<br><br>
